What is an array?
- A data structure containing an ordered collection of elements
- Items are stored at contiguous memory locations

Pros:
- Fast to access any element O(1)

Cons:
- Resizing requires rewriting; amortized O(1)
- Insertion/deletion into middle requires shifting other elements; O(n)

Other:
- Search is O(n)
